Sophisticated investors expect digital experiences that communicate expertise, trustworthiness and performance. Our objective is to design a next‑generation investment thesis platform that combines a professional dark aesthetic with subtle Roman and Nordic motifs to evoke longevity and mythological strength. The site will host a curated library of investment theses, research tools and interactive dashboards. To deliver a robust and user‑centred product, we compiled research from authoritative sources (2023‑2025) on fintech UX, design trends, data‑visualisation libraries, animation frameworks, typography and colours. This report summarises the findings, evaluates technology options and proposes a detailed site architecture and design system.

1.2 Investment thesis structure
P2P Market Data explains that a robust investment thesis should function like a strategic plan and include the following sections
p2pmarketdata.com
:

Section	Purpose
Introduction	Present the investment philosophy, high‑level goals and context.
Market overview	Analyse market size, growth rates, trends, competitors and regulatory landscape.
Thesis statement	Identify the opportunity and expected return drivers.
Rationale	Provide detailed research, economic drivers, competitive advantages and regulatory insights.
Investment strategy	Explain selection criteria, valuation methods, portfolio construction and diversification.
Risk factors	Identify market, industry and regulatory risks with mitigation strategies.
Exit strategy	Outline time horizon, target returns and exit mechanisms (e.g., IPO, sale).
Monitoring & evaluation	Define performance metrics (KPIs) and review cadence.

These sections will inform the structure of individual thesis pages.

1.3 Colour palettes and aesthetics
1.3.1 Roman and luxury colour palettes
Piktochart’s Roman Empire colour palette guide notes that Roman‑inspired palettes use rich reds and purples, serene blues, golden metallics, marble whites and earthy greens. Designers should balance bold and subtle tones, pair vibrant blues with earthy greens and incorporate metallic accents (gold/bronze) to evoke opulence and timeless elegance
piktochart.com
piktochart.com
. The guide recommends using these colours for headings or highlights and testing them across different contexts
piktochart.com
.

Design Work Life’s luxury colour palettes article emphasises rich jewel tones and metallic accents. Palettes such as “Midnight Opulence” (deep navy with crimson), “Golden Hour Elite” (rich gold and deep brown) and “Emerald Sophistication” (emerald greens with creamy backdrops) convey exclusivity and sophistication
designworklife.com
designworklife.com
designworklife.com
. These palettes align with our dark theme and can be combined with Roman metallics.

1.3.2 Scandinavian palettes & minimalism
Scandinavian colour palettes are known for simplicity and neutrality. A Piktochart article on Scandinavian palettes recommends starting with a neutral base (white, beige or light grey) and adding subtle pops of soft blues and earthy greens
piktochart.com
. The article encourages natural inspiration and minimalism: “keep the design simple and uncluttered, allowing the colours to speak for themselves”
piktochart.com
. These principles will inform our use of Nordic motifs.

A House in the Hills emphasises that minimalist design values simplicity and calmness. Palettes may include greys, beige, white, black‐and‑white combinations, natural wood tones, brown, taupe and occasional bold accents
ahouseinthehills.com
. Texture (e.g., stone or wood) adds warmth without clutter
ahouseinthehills.com
. Minimalist backgrounds will help the geometric shapes stand out.

1.3.3 Geometric minimalism
LogoVent’s Shapes in New Web Design Trends 2025 article states that geometric minimalism is popular in modern web design, especially for tech and finance. Circles, squares, triangles and hexagons bring precision and order
logovent.com
. This approach conveys reliability and professionalism, making it ideal for financial platforms
logovent.com
. Implementation tips include using grid‑based layouts, geometric icons and diagonal section dividers
logovent.com
. Best practices for geometric minimalism are to use a consistent colour palette, combine shapes with ample white space and experiment with symmetry and repetition
logovent.com
. A pro‑tip suggests using dynamic geometric patterns in the background, subtly animated to give a polished, futuristic vibe
logovent.com
.

1.4 Nordic typography and Roman type influences
Design Work Life’s Viking fonts guide explains that authentic Viking fonts use angular, runic elements reminiscent of carved runes
designworklife.com
. Fonts often have a weathered, carved appearance and may incorporate Norse motifs such as interlaced patterns, animals (wolves, ravens) or knotwork
designworklife.com
. These fonts convey strength and mythological power
designworklife.com
. However, they are best suited for headlines or logos; extended body text should pair them with more readable serif or sans‑serif fonts
designworklife.com
.

In contrast, neoclassical serif fonts communicate elegance and refinement. The Octet Design Studio guide notes that Didot, a high‑contrast serif created in the late 18th century, remains a symbol of sophistication and is ideal for headlines and luxury branding
octet.design
. Other modern serifs like Apparel and Monteci blend classic elegance with contemporary elements, combining geometric shapes with organic curves
octet.design
. Serif fonts are associated with tradition and readability
octet.design
.

1.5 Micro‑interactions and animations
Micro‑interactions are small, purposeful animations that improve user engagement and feedback. A Medium article lists common patterns: progressive disclosure, micro‑animations, hover interactions, focus states and micro‑copy
medium.com
. Studies show micro‑animations increase perceived speed and satisfaction and hover interactions can increase browsing time by 12%
medium.com
. Mack Media Group emphasises smooth transitions for hover effects and quick, subtle button animations to confirm actions
mackmediagroup.com
. The duration should be short and consistent with the colour scheme
mackmediagroup.com
.

1.6 Security and performance
Moon Technolabs’ fintech cybersecurity guide recommends practical measures for protecting financial data:

Multi‑factor authentication (MFA) – enable MFA to strengthen access control using passwords, biometrics or tokens
moontechnolabs.com
.

End‑to‑end data encryption – encrypt customers’ financial data both in transit and at rest
moontechnolabs.com
.

Regular security audits and updates – patch software to address vulnerabilities
moontechnolabs.com
.

AI‑based fraud detection tools – use machine learning to detect suspicious activity
moontechnolabs.com

3. Proposed information architecture
The site should be clear, hierarchical and user‑centric, with micro‑interactions enhancing navigation. The following architecture is recommended (content is summarised for brevity; actual pages may include additional sub‑sections):

3.1 Home page
Hero section with an overview of the platform, dark geometric background animated subtly (e.g., rotating hexagon grid). A tagline summarises the value proposition. A call‑to‑action (e.g., “Explore Investment Theses”) leads to the library.

Featured theses carousel or grid highlighting recent or top‑rated theses. Each card includes the thesis name, category and key metric summary. Hover reveals micro‑interaction (e.g., scale up, overlay information). Use D3/ECharts small charts (sparklines) to display performance trends.

Trust signals such as security badges (PCI DSS, GDPR compliance), testimonials, logos of partner institutions, and micro‑copy emphasising encryption and privacy.
webstacks.com
.

Quick links to Research & Insights, Tools & Calculators, About/Team and Contact.

3.2 Thesis Library & search
Search bar and filters to explore the thesis library by asset class, sector, date, risk level and performance metrics. Use auto‑suggest and dynamic filtering.

Responsive grid/list of thesis cards with thumbnail charts and key details. Provide sorting options (e.g., by return, risk, date).

Infinite scroll or pagination with lazy loading; micro‑interaction on hover. Each card links to an individual thesis page.

3.3 Individual thesis page
Each thesis page should be carefully structured according to the investment thesis template
p2pmarketdata.com
:

Introduction – summarise the opportunity and author; display a high‑level chart (e.g., performance vs. benchmark) and thesis metadata (date, asset class). Use a Viking font for the title and a neoclassical serif for sub‑headings.

Market Overview – interactive charts (e.g., market size, growth trends, competitor analysis) using ECharts. Provide context with bullet lists and citations.

Thesis Statement – clearly articulate the investment proposition and expected return drivers. Use call‑outs or quotes with serif fonts to emphasise key insights.

Rationale – detailed analysis (economic drivers, competitive landscape, regulatory environment). Use accordions or progressive disclosure micro‑interactions to avoid overwhelming the user
medium.com
.

Investment Strategy – describe asset selection criteria, position sizing, portfolio construction and diversification. Use tables or diagrams (SVG or ECharts) to visualise allocations.

Risk Factors – list potential risks (market, regulatory, liquidity) and mitigation strategies. Use icons (e.g., triangular caution icons) with tooltips for explanations.

Exit Strategy – outline exit timelines and triggers (e.g., target IRR, multiple). Use timelines or Gantt charts.

Monitoring & Evaluation – show KPIs, dashboards with live charts (e.g., returns vs. benchmark, volatility). Provide options to “Follow this thesis” or set alerts.

Comments & Discussion – allow authenticated investors to ask questions or share feedback. Use moderation and encryption.

Download/Share – provide options to download a PDF summary or share via secure links; ensure proper authentication.

piktochart.com
; used in charts and buttons.
Scandinavian neutral	#E5E5E5 / #F5F5F5	Light greys for text on dark backgrounds; ensures readability and provides subtle Nordic touch
piktochart.com
.
Emerald highlight	#0D5C43	From luxury palettes; adds sophistication and links to nature
designworklife.com
.

Gradients and metallic textures can accent hero sections or charts (e.g., gold gradient for call‑to‑action buttons). Use subtle patterns or mosaic overlays referencing Roman mosaics or Nordic knotwork.

4.2 Typography
Body text: Use a geometric sans‑serif like Futura, Inter or Circular for readability and modernity. These fonts have clean lines and align with geometric minimalism.

Headings / Section titles: Use a Viking‑inspired display font for hero headings and section titles (e.g., Viking Base Display, Old North). These fonts incorporate angular, runic elements and evoke mythological strength
designworklife.com
designworklife.com
. Reserve them for short phrases to avoid readability issues
designworklife.com
. Provide ample negative space around them
designworklife.com
.

Accent / Quotes: Use a neoclassical serif like Didot or Occitanie for quotes, call‑outs and thesis statements. Didot’s high contrast and elegant letterforms convey sophistication and are widely used in luxury branding
octet.design
. Modern serifs like Monteci blend geometric shapes with organic curves, adding warmth
octet.design
.

UI labels & buttons: Use a clean sans‑serif (e.g., Inter) with varying weights for clarity. Ensure high contrast between text and background.

4.3 Grid & layout
Grid system: Use a 12‑column grid with generous gutter spacing. The grid supports asymmetry within sections but maintains overall balance and alignment.

Geometric shapes: Use circles, hexagons, diagonal dividers and triangular motifs to divide sections and highlight content
logovent.com
. Experiment with symmetry and repetition
logovent.com
. Subtly animate background patterns using GSAP or Three.js (e.g., rotating hexagon mesh).

Layering: Introduce depth through layered or overlapping shapes; adjust opacity and use parallax for hero sections
logovent.com
. Ensure transparency is used strategically to avoid clutter
logovent.com
.

4.4 Micro‑interactions & animations
Hover effects: Use smooth, consistent transitions for interactive elements. Subtle scale, colour shift or shadow reveals clickable areas
mackmediagroup.com
.

Button feedback: Provide quick and efficient animations (e.g., ripple effect or icon morph) when users click or submit forms
mackmediagroup.com
.

Scroll‑triggered animations: Use ScrollMagic to reveal content sections with gentle fade/slide; animate charts as they enter viewport
dev.to
. Keep durations short and purposeful to maintain performance
dev.to
.

Loading indicators: Use animated runic symbols or rotating Roman coins via Lottie to communicate progress while aligning with the mythological theme.

Motion guidelines: Keep micro‑animations below 300 ms for subtle interactions and 500–1000 ms for complex sequence animations. Use ease‑in‑out or cubic‑bezier easing to feel natural. Provide user preferences to reduce motion for accessibility.

4.5 Dark/light mode
Provide a toggle that switches between dark mode (default) and light mode. Light mode uses reversed palette: dark text on light backgrounds with metallic accents. Use CSS variables for colours and ensure adequate contrast in both modes.

Persist user preference via localStorage or session cookies.

4.6 Accessibility considerations
Comply with WCAG 2.1 AA: high contrast ratio, focus indicators, keyboard navigation and screen reader support
webstacks.com
.

Use ARIA roles and labels for all interactive elements and dynamic charts.

Provide descriptive alt text for images and icons; avoid using colour as the sole means of conveying information.

Offer adjustable text sizes and support for reduced motion preferences.

4.7 Performance guidelines
Code splitting & lazy loading: Split JavaScript bundles by route; lazy load charts and animations only when needed. Use Next.js’s dynamic imports and React Suspense to improve time‑to‑interactive.

Image optimisation: Use modern formats (WebP/AVIF), serve responsive image sizes and apply compression. Use CSS for simple patterns where possible.

Caching & CDNs: Use HTTP caching strategies (ETags, Cache‑Control) and serve assets through CDNs (e.g., Cloudflare) for global performance. Prefetch critical resources.

Animation optimisation: Offload heavy animations to GPU by using CSS transforms and WebGL; throttle requestAnimationFrame loops; remove animations when off‑screen.

4.8 Security features
Transport security: Enforce HTTPS across all pages; implement HSTS and strong TLS cipher suites.

Authentication: Use multi‑factor authentication (password + OTP or biometric) for user logins
moontechnolabs.com
. Adopt OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect for third‑party sign‑in.

Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest using modern algorithms (AES‑256). Use hashing (e.g., Argon2) for passwords
moontechnolabs.com
.

Regular security audits: Schedule vulnerability scanning, penetration tests and patch management
moontechnolabs.com
.

Fraud detection: Integrate AI‑based monitoring to detect suspicious transactions
moontechnolabs.com
. Monitor transactions in real time
moontechnolabs.com
.

Incident response: Develop an incident response plan outlining detection, containment, notification to users/regulators and forensic investigation
moontechnolabs.com
.

Compliance: Adhere to data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA), PCI DSS for payments, and maintain privacy policies accessible to users.
webstacks.com
.

5. Technical stack & implementation plan
Front‑end: React 18 with Next.js for server‑side rendering (SSR) and SEO; TypeScript for type safety.

UI & styles: Combine Radix UI (headless components) with Tailwind CSS for custom geometric layouts. Use React Aria to ensure accessibility. Implement dark/light mode via CSS variables.

Data visualisation: Use ECharts for dashboards and time‑series charts; integrate D3.js for customised visuals. Provide interactive features (hover tooltips, zoom) while ensuring responsiveness. Lazy load heavy charts.

Animations: Use GSAP as the primary animation engine for micro‑interactions; integrate Three.js for 3D geometric backgrounds and ScrollMagic for scroll‑triggered animations. Use Framer Motion within React for page transitions and interactive components. Use Lottie for vector icons/animations (e.g., runic progress indicators).
