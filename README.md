Role and objectives: You are a senior product designer and full‑stack developer specialising in financial websites. Your task is to produce a comprehensive research report and detailed design specification for a next‑generation investment thesis website aimed at sophisticated investors. The site must be extremely well‑structured, visually distinctive yet professional, with a dark geometric aesthetic inspired by Palantir and infused with subtle Roman and Nordic mythological motifs. It must use multiple JavaScript libraries for data visualisation, animations, micro‑interactions and UI components.

Scope and deliverables:

Research summary – gather information from recent (2023–2025) authoritative sources on fintech website design, investment firm design trends, geometric minimalism, Roman and Nordic influences, colour palettes and typography. Identify best practices for trust, security, user‑centric design, performance optimisation and mobile responsiveness
